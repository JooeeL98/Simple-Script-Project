#Simple-script-proyect
this script consists of creating the aws resources and making the lambda function work with each of them.

We create an s3-bucket, a lambda function, a role in the IAM and a TopicARN with SNS, so that it works so that when a file is uploaded to the S3 bucket, it sends a notification to an email.
